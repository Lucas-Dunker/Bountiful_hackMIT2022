Bountiful is a game that encourages generosity, thoughtful thinking, and cooperation featuring the "bounty" system, an extensible game framework incentivizing active game development and donations to local charities.


*Players can utilize in-game virtual currency to fund projects 
-Active polling for new features

*Once a project is successfully funded in-game, new content is added to the game and a donation is made to charities of the players’ choice
-Partnerships with charities in the Boston community, US, worldwide, etc.

*Currency earned through simply playing the game, interacting with players
-Currency cap incentivizes players to cooperate with each other
-Additional benefits by doing tasks together


The “Bounty” System:
-A poll is set for possible features to be added to the game
-Once a winner is decided, a goal is made for players to reach in order for feature to be added
-Along with a feature, users vote for which charity a donation will be made to
-Multiple tiers of rewards depending on player performance

*For Bountiful, features can range from player trading, decorations, new game modes, and new levels to voice chat and personal lobbies


*Similar in concept/design to Kickstarter’s stretch goal system
